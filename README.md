# exo-matriz

This is the repository for 'exo-matriz', a narrative/ fabulative simulation game made as a research-creation project that explores agro-ecological systems and the interaction of beetle populations with traditional agricultural practices in Mexico.

## Art-research statement:

**Keywords:** agroecosystem, serious games, simulation, agent model, agriculture, ecology, traditional, cultural, narrative, education, fabulation

**Research question:** How can narrative-fabulation design, and game design, contribute to an understanding of agent dynamics within agroecosystem matrices in the context of traditional food production in Mexico? 

**Hypothesis:** The discipline of Narrative Design in games can be expanded to encompass a fabulative world-building approach to soft-fantasy ‘serious games’ with an educational aim. And can aid in the dissemination of scientific knowledge of agro-ecological systems known as ‘matrices’ in a cultural context of traditional farming practices in Mexico. 

**Research / narrative statement:** Growing populations and urbanized living encroach on traditional agricultural practices in the municipality of Zaachila (Oaxaca, Mexico). Both the avoidance of food shortages, and the preservation of the biodiversity that we depend on for survival are crucial objectives of our age. Researchers have found that the presence and behavior of beetle populations (Coleoptera) in agroecosystems is a good indicator of ‘matrix health’ across both of those domains of concern. Exomatriz is a top-down 2D simulation type game with soft-fantasy narrative elements that bridges the gap between science communication of how systems of variables in agroecosystems function, and the socio-cultural implications of human choice and non-human agency in an allegorical fabulative fictional setting.
